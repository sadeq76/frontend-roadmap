<h1> Frontend RoadMap </h1>
In short, the Web frontend encompasses everything that a user sees and interacts with on a website or web application.

Using markdown is my preferred method for learning frontend development:

<!-- <h2> What is prerequisite  </h2>

these are some of the essential concepts which you should know:

<ul>
  <li>what is programming language</li>
  <li>compiler vs interpreter</li>
  <li>Internet and protocols</li>
  <li>HTTP and HTTPS</li>
  <li>IP</li>
  <li>web1,2,3<li>
</ul> -->

<h2> Essential concepts </h2>

The most fundamental concepts in web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used for defining the structure of a webpage, CSS is utilized to apply styles and visual design to your website, and JavaScript enables interactive functionality and allows you to interact with elements on the page

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

After learning HTML and CSS, it is essential to practice applying these skills. You can find valuable resources on platforms like YouTube to further enhance your understanding. Once you feel comfortable with HTML and CSS, it is recommended to proceed to learn JavaScript. Similarly, practicing JavaScript is crucial to solidify your knowledge and gaining hands-on experience in building interactive web applications

<h2>CSS architectures</h2>

Learning CSS architectures can significantly improve your ability to write scalable, readable, and performant code. By understanding and implementing CSS architecture principles, you can structure your stylesheets in a modular and organized manner. This promotes code reusability, and maintainability, and facilitates easier collaboration with other developers. Additionally, CSS architectures often include techniques to optimize the performance of your code, resulting in faster loading times and smoother user experiences.

there is the list of them:

<ul>
<li>BEM</li>
<li>SMACSS</li>
<li>OOCSS</li>
<li>ITCSS</li>
<li>ACSS</li>
<li>CSS-in-JS</li>
</ul>

<h2>CSS preprocessors</h2>

Preprocessors can assist in reducing code duplication, promoting modularity, and enabling the use of variables and mixins, which contribute to smaller and more concise CSS code

there is a list of the most popular preprocessors:

<ul>
  <li>SASS (SCSS)</li>
  <li>LESS</li>
  <li>Stylus</li>
  <li>PostCSS</li>
</ul>

After learning one of these preprocessors, you should consider refactoring your previous projects. Applying the preprocessor's features and capabilities to your existing codebase will allow you to experience the noticeable difference it brings.

<h2>CSS frameworks</h2>
CSS frameworks can be categorized into several groups, such as component-based frameworks. It is crucial to analyze your requirements carefully to ensure you select the most suitable framework for your specific needs.

There are several highly popular CSS frameworks available: 

<ul>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Foundation</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
  <li>Materialize CSS</li>
  <li>and more ...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Javascript frameworks</h2>
Using frameworks can significantly enhance your application development process, allowing for faster development while ensuring superior performance.

this is a list of some of them:
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Vue</li>
  <li>Angular</li>
</ul>

Once you have gained proficiency in these topics, you can begin working on your projects and continue learning new topics concurrently during the coding process.

<h2>Module bundlers</h2>
Module bundlers are tools or libraries that consolidate multiple modules or JavaScript files into a single file, commonly known as a bundle. Their main objective is to handle module dependencies, resolve import and export statements, and optimize the resulting bundle for enhanced performance.

Typically, you can choose any of these bundlers and acquire proficiency by reading their documentation, without requiring an additional course.

<ul>
  <li>vite</li>
  <li>webpack</li>
  <li>Rollup</li>
  <li>Parcel</li>
  <li>Browserify</li>
  <li>and more ...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version controller</h2>

Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to files and folders over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, keep track of modifications, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. Version control is especially important in software development but can be useful for any type of file-based project

The most popular version control system is Git, and it is recommended to start with the basics before delving into advanced concepts

There are extensions and tools available that simplify working with Git, such as GitLens, which enhances the Git experience.

Finally, you would need a web-based hosting service for Git, with options like:

<ul>
  <li>GitHub</li>
  <li>GitLab</li>
  <li>Bitbucket</li>
</ul>

These platforms provide centralized platforms for storing your Git repositories and collaborating with other developers.
