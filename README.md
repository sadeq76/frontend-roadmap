<h1> Frontend RoadMap </h1>
In short, the <strong>frontend</strong> is everything a user sees and interacts with

<strong>Web front-end</strong> refers to the client-side development of a website or web application

This markdown is my way of learning the front-end.

<!-- <h2> What is prerequisite  </h2>

these are some of the essential concepts which you should know:

<ul>
  <li>what is programming language</li>
  <li>compiler vs interpreter</li>
  <li>Internet and protocols</li>
  <li>HTTP and HTTPS</li>
  <li>IP</li>
</ul> -->

<h2> Essential concepts </h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Javascript framework</li>
</ul>

<h3>Javascript frameworks</h3>
Using frameworks can significantly enhance your application development process, allowing for faster development while ensuring superior performance.

this is a list of some of them:
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Vue</li>
  <li>Angular</li>
</ul>

Once you have gained proficiency in these topics, you can begin working on your projects and continue learning new topics concurrently during the coding process.

<h2>Module bundlers</h2>
Module bundlers are tools or libraries that consolidate multiple modules or JavaScript files into a single file, commonly known as a bundle. Their main objective is to handle module dependencies, resolve import and export statements, and optimize the resulting bundle for enhanced performance.

Typically, you can choose any of these bundlers and acquire proficiency by reading their documentation, without requiring an additional course.

<ul>
  <li>vite</li>
  <li>webpack</li>
  <li>Rollup</li>
  <li>Parcel</li>
  <li>Browserify</li>
  <li>and more ...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version controller</h2>

Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to files and folders over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, keep track of modifications, and easily revert to previous versions if needed. Version control is especially important in software development but can be useful for any type of file-based project

The most popular version control system is Git, and it is recommended to start with the basics before delving into advanced concepts

There are extensions and tools available that simplify working with Git, such as GitLens, which enhances the Git experience.

Finally, you would need a web-based hosting service for Git, with options like:

<ul>
  <li>GitHub</li>
  <li>GitLab</li>
  <li>Bitbucket</li>
</ul>

These platforms provide centralized platforms for storing your Git repositories and collaborating with other developers.
